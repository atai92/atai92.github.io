            <h2>DIY (Do it Yourself!)</h2>
            <p>Whether they are virtual applications or physical objects, I love to build them! One of the things that I enjoy building the most are computers. The thrill of gathering components and assembling them into something that helps me build more things is very exciting and very fulfilling. There is little that can beat buying parts at places like Ikea and assembling them at home. <br><br> I also love seeing other people embark on great DIY projects as well. I occasionally frequent <a href="http://reddit.com/r/diy">Reddit/r/DIY</a> to see what people have done with their kitchens, furniture, home, etc. Although those DIY projects usually require more skill than I currently have, I hope one day I will acquire such a skill to be able to build something amazing from scratch.</p>
            <h2>Exercise</h2>
            <p>I love to do a little bit of exercise every day to make sure that I am healthy. However, health is just icing on the cake because I exercise to give myself a little more energy throughout the day and to have fun! </p>
            <h2>Games</h2>
            <p>I love getting together with friends to play board or table games. Having physical interaction with others in a friendly competition is extremely fun and rewarding.</p>
