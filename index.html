                    <h1>My Hobbies & Interests</h1>
                    <h2>DIY (Do it Yourself!)</h2>
                    <p>Whether they are virtual applications or physical objects, I love to build them! One of the things that
                        I enjoy building the most are computers. The thrill of gathering components and assembling them into
                        something that helps me build more things is very exciting and very fulfilling. There is little that
                        can beat buying parts at places like Ikea and assembling them at home.
                        <br>
                        <br> I also love seeing other people embark on great DIY projects as well. I occasionally frequent
                        <a href="http://reddit.com/r/diy">Reddit/r/DIY</a> to see what people have done with their kitchens,
                        furniture, home, etc. Although those DIY projects usually require more skill than I currently have,
                        I hope one day I will acquire such a skill to be able to build something amazing from scratch.</p>
                    <h2>Exercise</h2>
                    <p>I love to do a little bit of exercise every day to make sure that I am healthy. However, health is just
                        icing on the cake because I exercise to give myself a little more energy throughout the day and to
                        have fun! </p>
                    <h2>Games</h2>
                    <p>I love getting together with friends to play board or table games. Having physical interaction with others
                        in a friendly competition is extremely fun and rewarding.</p>
                    <h2>Swimming</h2>
                    <p>I know I know. This should fall under exercise, but this is one of my hobbies that I really like that
                        I don't do as often as exercise, so I didn't want to clump them into one category. I do, however,
                        LOVE swimming more than the exercises I usually do five times a week. Dipping my head into the water
                        and gliding through the water clears my head. It feels really relaxing and helps me concentrate on
                        a single thought.</p>
