var entry = h1 + "June 26th, 2015" + h1s + "Today we went to Dinosaur Valley and saw some dinosaurs. Met a little girl on the same tour who, I thought, spoke only Mandarin. Apparently her name is Nicole, she is 9 years old, and is from New Jersey." + dbl + "The story behind how we met Nicole is pretty hilarious. My cousins (and Wade), my sister, and I were sitting down after the dinosaur tour and Nicole decided to sit next to me. There was a leaf on the seat next to me and she cleaned it instead of sitting like 4 inches further. I thought that was weird so I pointed that out to my cousins and out of nowhere Nicole blurts that '[she's] nine years old!' I turned to face her with my mouth wide-open; I was speechless. She probably heard what I said. My cousins and I laughed for a bit. I asked her where she was from and who she was with. She is a pretty cool kid. While we're not at our bus, we would all occasionally walk together and talk.";
