var entry = h1 + "June 25th, 2015" + h1s + "Left San Francisco on June 24th and arrived in Hong Kong June 26th. But that wasn't our final destination. We had to wait 5 more hours to transfer from Hong Kong to Kwunming, China. We basically wasted an entire day due to travel time and traveling was super tiring. At least I got to watch `The Maze Runner` and `Hercules.` Oh and I DO NOT recommend watching `Hercules` (the one with Dwayne Johnson)." + dbl + "Once we got to Kwunming, we immediately got our baggage and hopped into our little tour van. The driver was crazy! I sat in the front seat and I saw him weave in and out of lanes without signalling. Not to mention he cut off at least 10 cars. And by cut off I mean he started changing lanes before the van even passed the car besides us. The driver wouldn't even let anyone cut him off. Any time someone tried, he would just speed up and honk a few times. China's highways are definitely full of surprises. We got to one intersection two separate drivers on mopeds had to stop so they wouldn't collide with us. These mopeds would have sandwiched us!" + dbl + "At least there were no surprises at our hotel. The only downside was there is no gym even though their brochure had pictures of one... After checking into our hotel we went to look around since our tour of Kwunming doesn't start until tomorrow (June 26th). We went a few blocks and saw that it started to rain so we sat down at a restaurant that was fairly busy. It seemed like there were more people in this restaurant than there were people on the street! The food was pretty good. <br><img src='assets/img/IMG_20150625_185154.jpg' style='position: static; display:inline-block; float:left; width:400px; height:auto;border-radius:0;border:3px solid gray; margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 20px'/> We had roasted duck, bitter melon, bean sprouts, spicy beef stew with rice noodles, bread, fried rice, some veges, and sweet & sour fish. The roasted duck had very little meat on it but it was pretty crispy and still had that roasted duck flavor. The bitter melon was, well, bitter, but it was very `refreshing.` The bean sprouts were delicious, but that's because you can't go wrong with bean sprouts! The spicy beef stew with rice noodles was pretty spicey but very flavorful and one of my favorite dishes today.  The bread didn't have any taste... The fried rice looked really plain, but was surprisingly delicious and was made in a clay pot instead of a traditional wok. The veges were as good as can be. Finally, the sweet & sour fish tasted like any sweet & sour fish that wasn't deep fried before being sauced up. The meal was under 300 RMB (less than 60 USD) so it was pretty cheap for how much food we had and the overall meal was very enjoyable." + dbl + "Sorry for the lack of pictures... I was too busy snapchatting instead of taking real pictures for my blog, but I'll try to take more next time!";

Apparently her name is Nicole and she is on tour with just her mother." + dbl + "The story behind how we met Nicole is pretty hilarious. My cousins (and Wade), my sister, and I were sitting down after the dinosaur tour and Nicole decided to sit next to me. There was a leaf on the seat next to me and she cleaned it instead of sitting like 4 inches further. I thought that was weird so I pointed that out to my cousins and out of nowhere Nicole blurts that '[she's] nine years old!' I turned to face her with my mouth wide-open; I was speechless. She probably heard what I said. My cousins and I laughed for a bit. I asked her where she was from and who she was with. She is a pretty cool kid. While we're not at our bus, we would all occasionally walk together and talk.";
