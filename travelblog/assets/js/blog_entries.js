  "<h1>June 21st, 2015</h1>Created a blog to record my travels. I will start my adventure in China and go to Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. I'll try to keep this as up-to-date as possible, so please drop by and check it out once in a while! I will occasionally post a status update on Facebook whenever there is more stuff! I can't wait to travel and I can't wait to share it with you all. :)<br><br><strong>And don't worry guys. There will definitely be pictures!</strong>"
